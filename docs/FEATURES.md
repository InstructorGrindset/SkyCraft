# SkyCraft fork features

Features this fork (InstructorGrindset/SkyCraft) adds on top of upstream SkyCraft 0.1.2. The base
game features (movement, blocks, digging, combat, skills) are described in the README and
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md). Every config file below lives in the Minecraft instance's `config` folder
and is written with defaults the first time it's needed; delete a file to get the new defaults
back.

Status: **Tested** means played and confirmed in game, **Built** means it compiles and passes unit
tests but hasn't been played yet.

## Feature map

Every feature can be switched off in `skycraft-features.txt` (restart Minecraft after editing).
Minecraft side paths are under `fabric/src/main/java/dev/skycraft/`, Skyrim side under `skse/src/`.

| Feature | Switch | What it does | Minecraft side | Skyrim side | Config | Log tag | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kill drops | `kill_drops` | Skyrim animals you kill drop Minecraft meat, leather and bones | `loot/SkyLoot`, `loot/LootRules` | actor table | `skycraft-loot.txt` | `SkyCraft-loot` | Tested |
| Kill XP | `kill_xp` | Credited kills drop XP orbs, more for higher levels | `loot/KillXp`, `loot/SkyLoot` | actor table level | none | `SkyCraft-loot` | Built |
| Item conversion | `item_conversion` | Food, potions, ores, hides and salvaged gear you loot in Skyrim become Minecraft items, and so do torches, tools, kitchenware, Dwemer clutter, Hearthfire building materials, animal parts, alchemy reagents, fish and gems (`+` gives several items for one); clothing and jewelry rules wait, commented out, for a decision; quest items never convert. Full table in `docs/CONVERSIONS.md` | `loot/SkyBridge`, `loot/ItemRules` | `Loot.cpp` (container sink, Take) | `skycraft-items.txt` | `SkyCraft-loot` | Tested |
| Potions | `item_conversion` | Every Skyrim potion becomes a Minecraft potion with effects of its own, named like the Skyrim one (health red, magicka blue, stamina green), and every poison a splash potion: 57 alchemy effects map to Minecraft effects (Restore Health is Instant Health, magicka is Absorption, Barter is Hero of the Village, Smithing is Haste, Paralysis is Slowness V, ...), with level and seconds growing with the name's tier (Minor and Weak up to Ultimate, Grand and Prime). Cure Disease and Cure Poison give a milk bucket; the White Phial and the quest poisons stay. Rules write `minecraft:potion{haste:0-2:60-180 #rrggbb "Name"}`, or `minecraft:potion[healing]` for a vanilla potion, also for `splash_potion`, `lingering_potion` and `tipped_arrow`. Long names cut to 27 letters come back whole. Full table in `docs/CONVERSIONS.md` | `loot/ItemRules` ("Potions and poisons" section, `Effect`, `TIERS`, `LONG_NAMES`), `loot/SkyBridge` (potion contents, custom name) | `Loot.cpp` (VendorItemPotion, VendorItemPoison tags) | `skycraft-items.txt` | `SkyCraft-loot` | Built |
| Dungeon chests | `dungeon_chests` | First loot of each dungeon chest also rolls a Minecraft chest loot table | `loot/DungeonLoot` | `WorldState::Place` (dungeon flag), item event chest flag and container id | `skycraft-dungeons.txt`, `skycraft-opened-chests.txt` | `SkyCraft-loot` | Built |
| Merchants | `merchants` | Right click a Skyrim vendor with an empty hand for a villager trade screen; town prices, supply and demand, Speech XP | `trade/` (SkyTrade, TradeRules, Currency, Demand), `combat/SkyrimActorEntity.interact` | `WorldState::VendorMask`, `WorldState::Place` (town) | `skycraft-trades.txt`, `skycraft-towns.txt` | `SkyCraft-trade` | Built |
| Time sync | `time_sync` | Minecraft's clock follows Skyrim's game hour | `time/SkyTime` | SkyState game hour | none | `SkyCraft-time` | Built |
| Bed sleep | `bed_sleep` | A full night in a Minecraft bed passes the night in Skyrim (needs time sync for beds to work at night) | `time/SkyTime` | `WorldState::PassTime` | none | `SkyCraft-time` | Built |
| Deep mining | none | Bedrock 64 blocks under the land (however deep, under buried rocks, ore veins and cave mouths too; in interiors 64 under the floor above), ores by depth, deepslate layer. Ground under the land never opens into nothing: undug cells beside a hole are solid, old holes close as you pass, and a player who still ends up in the void, or put inside rock by Skyrim, goes back to safe open ground | `world/SkyDig`, `world/SkyGround`, `world/SafeSpot`, client `FallGuard` | `Dig.cpp`, `Collision.cpp` (the land over a deep tunnel), `DigPhysics.cpp` (no Skyrim land rescue for the player) | none | `SkyCraft` | Built |
| Deep creatures | `deep_creatures` | Skeevers, skeletons and draugr spawn in dark tunnels you dug, by depth | `deep/` (SkyDeep, DeepRules) | `Spawn.cpp` | `skycraft-deep.txt` | `SkyCraft-deep` | Built |
| Breach doors | `breach_doors` | A hidden antechamber under each dungeon entrance (12 blocks down for low levels, deeper for higher ones), walled in the dungeon's theme (Nordic, Dwemer, Falmer, mine, fort, lair, cave). Its walls need a good enough pickaxe (iron for Dwemer and lairs, stone for Nordic, Falmer and forts); its sealed iron door takes you into the real dungeon. Particles and sounds leak through the rock near it, its name shows when you break in, and the first breach of an uncleared dungeon has a loot chest | `breach/` (SkyBreach, BreachPlanner, BreachRoom, BreachStore, BreachBlocks), hooks in `world/SkyDig` and `world/SkyDigBlast` | breach table, `kEvEnterDungeon` | `skycraft-dungeons.txt` (chest tables), `skycraft-breaches.txt` in the world's save folder | `SkyCraft-breach` | Built |
| Click to activate | `click_to_activate` | Right click with nothing usable in hand activates the Skyrim door, container, NPC, item, furniture or lever under the crosshair, as G does. Minecraft goes first: the held item is used (blocks placed, food eaten, bows drawn, shields raised), Minecraft blocks and entities take the click, and an empty hand on a merchant still opens the trade screen. Only a fresh press counts, so holding right click never activates anything; at most one activation per 0.4 s | client source set: `client/ClickActivate`, `client/mixin/MinecraftUseMixin`; `combat/SkyrimActorEntity` (merchant vendor mask synced so the client sees the trade take the click) | `Input.cpp` (`UpdateClickActivate`, same activation as G), `kEvActivate` | none | `SkyCraft` | Built |
| Minecraft view | `minecraft_view` | In any dimension other than the Skyrim mirror (the Nether, Tamriel Wilds, Home, ...) the screen shows Minecraft's own world: Minecraft draws its world, hand and HUD and sends the whole picture (at most 1080 high, `-Dskycraft.viewMaxHeight`, Skyrim scales it up) to cover Skyrim's. Skyrim keeps running underneath and parks its player where they stood: held in place, god mode, nobody fighting them, HUD hidden, its world not drawn. Every Skyrim-coupled system stands down meanwhile (collision, dug ground, water, NPC stand-ins, loot and items, time, breaches, deep creatures, click to activate, Skyrim's teleports and look); keys and mouse go to Minecraft, which turns the player itself. Back in the mirror, Skyrim's player follows to wherever Minecraft's comes back in (Skyrim leads instead if its player died there or is in another Skyrim world). Dying over there kills the Skyrim player as anywhere. Debug: `/skyview` (host only) goes to the Nether, or any other dimension the world has, and back; `/skyview <dimension id>`, `/skyview mirror`. Off: other dimensions act like the mirror, as before | `SkyDimension` (the guard every system asks), client `MinecraftView`, `FrameExporter` (opaque frames), `SkyClient`, `InputBridge` (look), guards in the `mixin/` and `client/mixin/` classes, `combat/SkyCombat`, `net/SkyNet`, `breach/SkyBreach` | `View.cpp` (park, hand back), `Overlay.cpp` (full screen frame), `Input.cpp` (routing, `kInLook`), `Game.cpp` | `SkyCraft.ini` `[MinecraftView] bHideSkyrimWorld` | `SkyCraft`, `Minecraft view` in SkyCraft.log | Built |
| Gear sets | none | Skyrim Iron through Daedric weapons and armor, new materials, recipes, original textures | `gear/` (SkyGear, GearTiers), `mixin/SmithingMixin` | none | data in the jar | none | Built |
| Portal network | `portals` | Portals are cracks between places that resemble each other. An obsidian frame lit in Skyrim makes a real Nether portal, but vanilla Nether travel never happens from the mirror world. A filled Greater, Grand or Black soul gem from Skyrim (bought or looted filled) becomes a Filled Soul Gem; used on a lit portal it becomes an Attuned Soul Gem, and used on a second lit portal it binds the two for good and is spent. After Minecraft's usual portal wait a bound portal takes the host to its partner behind a loading screen, like a load door, between worldspaces and interiors alike. Unbound portals do nothing but say how to bind them; breaking a frame unbinds its partner. Merchants sell obsidian dear (smiths, cheapest in Markarth, and general stores) | `portal/` (SkyPortals, PortalStore, PortalItems, SoulGemItem), `mixin/NetherPortalBlockMixin`, soul gem rules in `loot/ItemRules`, obsidian in `trade/TradeRules` | `Travel.cpp` (MoveTo_Impl with no target reference), `Loot.cpp` (soul gem tags), `kEvPortalTravel` | `skycraft-portals.txt` in the world's save folder, `skycraft-items.txt` ("Soul gems" section), `skycraft-trades.txt` | `SkyCraft-portal` | Built |

Shared pieces: `config/Config` reads and writes the config files, `config/Features` holds the
switches, `link/` is the shared memory link, and `WorldState.cpp` on the Skyrim side reports the
player's town and place and merchants' buy lists. Place changes are logged as `SkyCraft-place`.

## Planned

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| Farming on Skyrim soil | May already work with dug dirt; needs a test first |
| Tamed companions | A Skyrim dog or horse shows up as a Minecraft wolf or horse that follows you |
| Artifacts | About 20 named Skyrim artifacts as unique Minecraft items with real enchantments |

## Protocol 13

The shared memory protocol went from 12 to 13 for these features. Both halves must match.

| Addition | Direction | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `SkyState.town`, `SkyState.place` (PlaceFlags) | Skyrim to Minecraft | Merchants, dungeon chests |
| `ActorRecord.vendor` (VendorBuys) | Skyrim to Minecraft | Merchants |
| `ActorFlags::kActorSpawned` | Skyrim to Minecraft | Deep creatures cap |
| `ItemEvent.chest`, `ItemEvent.container` | Skyrim to Minecraft | Dungeon chests |
| `ItemEvent.quest` | Skyrim to Minecraft | Item conversion skips quest items |
| `kEvSleep` | Minecraft to Skyrim | Bed sleep |
| `kEvSpawnCreature` | Minecraft to Skyrim | Deep creatures |
| `BreachTable` | Skyrim to Minecraft | Breach doors |
| `kEvEnterDungeon` | Minecraft to Skyrim | Breach doors |
| `kEvActivate` (10) | Minecraft to Skyrim | Click to activate. Added within 13 without a version bump: an older Skyrim plugin ignores the event type |
| `kEvPortalTravel` (11), `PortalTravelFlags` | Minecraft to Skyrim | Portal network: formId = destination worldspace, or interior cell with `kPortalInterior`; a/b/c = feet (MC coords), d = yaw, weapon = the world it was sent from (stale requests dropped). Added within 13 |
| `ItemTags` `kTagSoulGem`, `kTagSoulFilled` (bits 17, 18) | Skyrim to Minecraft | Portal network: soul gems that come filled convert to Filled Soul Gems. Added within 13; an older plugin never sets them |

The Minecraft view added these within 13, without a version bump (an older half ignores them):

| Addition | Direction | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `McFlags::kMcOtherDimension` (bit 8) | Minecraft to Skyrim | The player is in a dimension other than the mirror. Skyrim parks its player while it's set and takes Minecraft's position on the falling edge |
| `OverlayFlags::kOverlayOpaque` (`OverlaySlotHdr.flags` bit 1) | Minecraft to Skyrim | The frame is Minecraft's whole picture, drawn full screen with its alpha ignored |
| `kInLook` (9) | Skyrim to Minecraft | Raw mouse motion while away; Minecraft turns its player itself |
| `McViewEventType` `kEvEnterOtherDimension` (12), `kEvLeaveOtherDimension` (13) | Minecraft to Skyrim | Reserved and not sent: Skyrim follows `kMcOtherDimension`, a state a dropped event or a reconnect can't leave stale |

## Testing a build

1. Back up the Skyrim saves folder.
2. Install the jar into the instance's `mods` folder and the DLL into `Data/SKSE/Plugins`, keeping
   the previous ones in `dev-backups`.
3. Play the feature tests for the build.
4. Read `Documents/My Games/Skyrim Special Edition/SKSE/SkyCraft.log` and the instance's
   `logs/latest.log`, searching for the log tags above.
