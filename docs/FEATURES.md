# SkyCraft fork features

Features this fork (InstructorGrindset/SkyCraft) adds on top of upstream SkyCraft 0.1.2. The base
game features (movement, blocks, digging, combat, skills) are described in the README and
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md). Every config file below lives in the Minecraft instance's `config` folder
and is written with defaults the first time it's needed; delete a file to get the new defaults
back.

Status: **Tested** means played and confirmed in game, **Built** means it compiles and passes unit
tests but hasn't been played yet.

## Feature map

Every feature can be switched off in `skycraft-features.txt` (restart Minecraft after editing).
Minecraft side paths are under `fabric/src/main/java/dev/skycraft/`, Skyrim side under `skse/src/`.

| Feature | Switch | What it does | Minecraft side | Skyrim side | Config | Log tag | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kill drops | `kill_drops` | Skyrim animals you kill drop Minecraft meat, leather and bones | `loot/SkyLoot`, `loot/LootRules` | actor table | `skycraft-loot.txt` | `SkyCraft-loot` | Tested |
| Kill XP | `kill_xp` | Credited kills drop XP orbs, more for higher levels | `loot/KillXp`, `loot/SkyLoot` | actor table level | none | `SkyCraft-loot` | Built |
| Item conversion | `item_conversion` | Food, potions, ores, hides and salvaged gear you loot in Skyrim become Minecraft items; quest items never convert | `loot/SkyBridge`, `loot/ItemRules` | `Loot.cpp` (container sink, Take) | `skycraft-items.txt` | `SkyCraft-loot` | Tested |
| Potions | `item_conversion` | Skyrim potions become the Minecraft potion with the nearest effect (Healing, Strength for Warrior and Berserker, Invisibility, Swiftness for stamina, Regeneration for magicka, Fire Resistance, Water Breathing), stronger Skyrim tiers giving the strong or long potion; poisons become splash Harming, Poison, Slowness or Weakness. Skyrim only effects (Smithing, Illusion, Cure Disease, Frenzy, ...) stay in Skyrim. Rules write `minecraft:potion[healing]`, also for `splash_potion`, `lingering_potion` and `tipped_arrow` | `loot/ItemRules` ("Potions and poisons" section), `loot/SkyBridge` (potion contents) | `Loot.cpp` (VendorItemPotion, VendorItemPoison tags) | `skycraft-items.txt` | `SkyCraft-loot` | Built |
| Dungeon chests | `dungeon_chests` | First loot of each dungeon chest also rolls a Minecraft chest loot table | `loot/DungeonLoot` | `WorldState::Place` (dungeon flag), item event chest flag and container id | `skycraft-dungeons.txt`, `skycraft-opened-chests.txt` | `SkyCraft-loot` | Built |
| Merchants | `merchants` | Right click a Skyrim vendor with an empty hand for a villager trade screen; town prices, supply and demand, Speech XP | `trade/` (SkyTrade, TradeRules, Currency, Demand), `combat/SkyrimActorEntity.interact` | `WorldState::VendorMask`, `WorldState::Place` (town) | `skycraft-trades.txt`, `skycraft-towns.txt` | `SkyCraft-trade` | Built |
| Time sync | `time_sync` | Minecraft's clock follows Skyrim's game hour | `time/SkyTime` | SkyState game hour | none | `SkyCraft-time` | Built |
| Bed sleep | `bed_sleep` | A full night in a Minecraft bed passes the night in Skyrim (needs time sync for beds to work at night) | `time/SkyTime` | `WorldState::PassTime` | none | `SkyCraft-time` | Built |
| Deep mining | none | Bedrock 64 blocks down, ores by depth, deepslate layer | `world/SkyDig` | `Dig.cpp` | none | `SkyCraft` | Tested |
| Deep creatures | `deep_creatures` | Skeevers, skeletons and draugr spawn in dark tunnels you dug, by depth | `deep/` (SkyDeep, DeepRules) | `Spawn.cpp` | `skycraft-deep.txt` | `SkyCraft-deep` | Built |
| Breach doors | `breach_doors` | A hidden antechamber under each dungeon entrance (12 blocks down for low levels, deeper for higher ones), walled in the dungeon's theme (Nordic, Dwemer, Falmer, mine, fort, lair, cave). Its walls need a good enough pickaxe (iron for Dwemer and lairs, stone for Nordic, Falmer and forts); its sealed iron door takes you into the real dungeon. Particles and sounds leak through the rock near it, its name shows when you break in, and the first breach of an uncleared dungeon has a loot chest | `breach/` (SkyBreach, BreachPlanner, BreachRoom, BreachStore, BreachBlocks), hooks in `world/SkyDig` and `world/SkyDigBlast` | breach table, `kEvEnterDungeon` | `skycraft-dungeons.txt` (chest tables), `skycraft-breaches.txt` in the world's save folder | `SkyCraft-breach` | Built |
| Gear sets | none | Skyrim Iron through Daedric weapons and armor, new materials, recipes, original textures | `gear/` (SkyGear, GearTiers), `mixin/SmithingMixin` | none | data in the jar | none | Built |

Shared pieces: `config/Config` reads and writes the config files, `config/Features` holds the
switches, `link/` is the shared memory link, and `WorldState.cpp` on the Skyrim side reports the
player's town and place and merchants' buy lists. Place changes are logged as `SkyCraft-place`.

## Planned

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| Farming on Skyrim soil | May already work with dug dirt; needs a test first |
| Tamed companions | A Skyrim dog or horse shows up as a Minecraft wolf or horse that follows you |
| Artifacts | About 20 named Skyrim artifacts as unique Minecraft items with real enchantments |

## Protocol 13

The shared memory protocol went from 12 to 13 for these features. Both halves must match.

| Addition | Direction | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `SkyState.town`, `SkyState.place` (PlaceFlags) | Skyrim to Minecraft | Merchants, dungeon chests |
| `ActorRecord.vendor` (VendorBuys) | Skyrim to Minecraft | Merchants |
| `ActorFlags::kActorSpawned` | Skyrim to Minecraft | Deep creatures cap |
| `ItemEvent.chest`, `ItemEvent.container` | Skyrim to Minecraft | Dungeon chests |
| `ItemEvent.quest` | Skyrim to Minecraft | Item conversion skips quest items |
| `kEvSleep` | Minecraft to Skyrim | Bed sleep |
| `kEvSpawnCreature` | Minecraft to Skyrim | Deep creatures |
| `BreachTable` | Skyrim to Minecraft | Breach doors |
| `kEvEnterDungeon` | Minecraft to Skyrim | Breach doors |

## Testing a build

1. Back up the Skyrim saves folder.
2. Install the jar into the instance's `mods` folder and the DLL into `Data/SKSE/Plugins`, keeping
   the previous ones in `dev-backups`.
3. Play the feature tests for the build.
4. Read `Documents/My Games/Skyrim Special Edition/SKSE/SkyCraft.log` and the instance's
   `logs/latest.log`, searching for the log tags above.
